This API\nincludes accessing objects in a dynamic fashion (read properties, write\nproperties, and call methods), inspecting types (for example, whether a\nmethod exists), and symbol/string convertion.</p>\n<p>The package provides a default implementation of this API that uses the system's\nmirrors, but additionally provides mechanisms for statically generating code\nthat can replace the mirror-based implementation.</p>\n<p>The intention of this package is to allow frameworks to use mirrors in a way\nthat will not impose on their users. The idea is that users will not worry about\nhow to preserve symbols when compiling with dart2js (for instance, using the\n<a href=\"https://api.dartlang.org/apidocs/channels/stable/#dart-mirrors.MirrorsUsed\">MirrorsUsed</a> annotation). Instead, this package provides the building\nblocks to autogenerate whatever is needed for dart2js to be happy and to\ngenerate reasonable code.</p>\n<p>Note this package alone doesn't know how to generate everything, but it provides\na simple API that different frameworks can use to define what needs to be\ngenerated.</p>\n<h1>Smoke reflective API</h1>\n<p>Use <code>package:smoke/smoke.dart</code> in your framework to read and write objects and\nto inspect type information. Read the Dart-docs for more details.</p>\n<h1>Code Generation</h1>\n<p>TBD. We envision we'll have a base transformer class that can be tailored to\ncreate a transformer for your framework.</p>"}
