Using a version range lets you upgrade your\npackage at your own pace. You can find the latest version number at\n<a href=\"https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/polymer\">https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/polymer</a>.</p>\n<h2>Building and Deploying</h2>\n<p>To build a deployable version of your app, add the polymer transformers to your\npubspec.yaml file:</p>\n<pre class=\"yaml\"><code>transformers:\n- polymer\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, run <code>pub build</code>.  The polymer transformers assume all files under <code>web</code>\nare possible entry points, this can be adjusted with arguments in your\npubspec.yaml file. For example, you can say only <code>web/index.html</code> is an entry\npoint as follows:</p>\n<pre class=\"yaml\"><code>transformers:\n- polymer:\n    entry_points: web/index.html\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here is a list of arguments used by the polymer transformers:\n* js: whether to load JS code directly. By default polymer converts your app's\n  html file to load the compiled JS code directly. Setting this parameter to\n  false will keep a dart script tag and the <code>dart.js</code> script tag on the page.</p><ul><li>\n<p>csp: whether to load a Content Security Policy (CSP) compliant JS file.\n  Dart2js generates two JS files, one that is not CSP compilant and one that is.\n  By default, polymer uses the former becuase it's likely more efficient, but\n  you can choose the latter by setting this flag.</p></li><li>\n<p>entry_points: can be a list of entry points or, for convenience, a single\n  entry point as shown above.</p></li></ul>\n<p>For example, this specification includes 2 entrypoints and chooses the CSP\ncompliant JS file:</p>\n<pre class=\"yaml\"><code>transformers:\n- polymer:\n    entry_points:\n    - web/index.html\n    - web/index2.html\n    csp: true\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Contacting Us</h2>\n<p>Please file issues in our <a href=\"http://dartbug.com/new\">Issue Tracker</a> or contact us on the\n<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/web-ui\">Dart Web UI mailing list</a>.</p>\n<p>We also have the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/web-ui-dev\">Web UI development list</a> for discussions about\ninternals of the code, code reviews, etc.</p>"}
